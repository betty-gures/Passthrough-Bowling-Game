## Idea

With a mechanic involving both hands (palms facing each other, and adjusting the distance between the hands), the user shall be able to create primitive geometric gameobjects (ex: spheres, cubes, cylinders of different sizes, size is defined by the player through the creation mechanic).

By placing the created objects in 3D space, the player creates artistic spaces and experiences. 

## Features

**Core features:** 

These are the features that your prototype really needs to function or to prove your point.

- The user shall create primitive 3D objects
- Some way of choosing the primitive
- The user shall decide on the size of the objects (core mechanic)
- The user shall place objects as they desire
- The user shall be able to position the pieces in the 3D space (glue or create them in right spot)
- The system shall offer color pallets to the users
- Objects shall appear with an initial color, assigned randomly according to the chosen color pallet

**Stretch goals:** 

These are features that are nice to have, and that you might implement if you have extra time, or in the future.

- The user shall be able to paint objects, with a paintball weapon
- The user shall be able to walk over small objects (creating stairs with smaller boxes)
- The user shall add sound that can be added to objects (as player moves through the space they may hear the audio play).
- The user shall add lights, change lights, change skybox colors within gameplay
- The user shall add particles within gameplay
- The system shall have a nice ui and ux, that is easy to navigate
- There can be a free mode, in addition to the color pallet sugestions

* This repository will be updated on a regular pace, for one week (26th October 2022).
* At the end of the week, a beautiful, running and error free VR protoype will be delivered.
